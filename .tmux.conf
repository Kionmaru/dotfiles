# GNU screen password bug on my mac. I can either custom code a work-around
# or switch to tmux. Tired of really dirty hacks to make screen do what I want,
# and what other things support as first class citizens.
#
# I'm sorry, screen, it's been really wonderful, but I need to take a
# break.


# Make it feel more home-y
unbind C-b
set-option -g prefix C-a
bind-key C-a send-prefix

# Make splits what I expect them to be (my old screen keys)
bind | split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind S split-window -v -c "#{pane_current_path}"
unbind '"'
unbind %

# Use the ctrl+vim mode keys to navigate that I like.
setw -g mode-keys vi
bind-key -n 'C-h' select-pane -L
bind-key -n 'C-j' select-pane -D
bind-key -n 'C-k' select-pane -U
bind-key -n 'C-l' select-pane -R
bind-key -n 'C-\' select-pane -l

# screen is a nice default shell; BUT I want my pretty colors. 
# xterm-256color is pretty bog standard for this.
set -g default-terminal "xterm-256color"
